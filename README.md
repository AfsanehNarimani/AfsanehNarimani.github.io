**Profile**

Motivated researcher with a solid foundation in artificial intelligence and deep learning, with
specific expertise in medical image analysis and backend system design. My MSc thesis focused
on brain tumor segmentation using convolutional neural networks and was ranked on the
**BRATS 2018 Leaderboard**. This work strongly aligns with Professor Mohammad Kohandel’s
research in computational oncology and mathematical modeling of cancer. With a strong
programming background (Java, Python, C++), I am passionate about applying mathematical
models and machine learning to biomedical problems and aim to contribute meaningfully to
interdisciplinary cancer research.
